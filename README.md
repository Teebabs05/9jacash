# 9JACASH

A production-grade online earning platform (mining, tasks, referrals, ads,
spin wheel, daily check-in, wallet, deposits/withdrawals) built entirely in
**Core PHP 8.2+, MySQL/PDO, Bootstrap 5 and vanilla JavaScript** — no
frameworks.

> This repository is being built module by module. See **Build Status**
> below for what is implemented today.

## Tech Stack

- PHP 8.2+ (PDO, no framework)
- MySQL 8 / MariaDB 10.6+
- Bootstrap 5 (vendored locally, no CDN dependency)
- Vanilla JavaScript (AJAX where needed)
- PHPMailer (the only Composer dependency, per project spec)
- Self-hosted Poppins font + Bootstrap Icons (no Google Fonts / icon CDN)

## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.2 with `pdo_mysql`, `mbstring`, `openssl`, `curl`, `fileinfo`, `gd` (optional)
- MySQL/MariaDB
- Apache with `mod_rewrite` (shared hosting / cPanel compatible)

## Installation

1. Upload the entire project to your web root (or a subdirectory).
2. Create a MySQL database and user in cPanel (or your host's control panel).
3. Visit `https://yourdomain.com/install/` in your browser.
4. Follow the 4-step wizard:
   1. **Requirements Check** — verifies PHP version, extensions and folder permissions.
   2. **Database Configuration** — enter your DB host/name/user/password; the wizard tests the connection.
   3. **Site & Administrator Setup** — set your site name/URL and create your admin login. This step imports `database.sql` automatically.
   4. **Finish** — the wizard writes `config.php` and locks itself with `install/installed.lock`.
5. **Delete or restrict `/install`** after installation (the wizard blocks itself once `install/installed.lock` exists, but removing the folder is best practice).

A default administrator is also seeded directly inside `database.sql` in case
you import the schema manually instead of using the wizard:

```
Username: admin
Password: 1988125012
```

Change this password immediately after your first login. The install wizard
lets you overwrite these credentials during Step 3.

### Manual installation (without the wizard)

1. Import `database.sql` into your database.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust mail/PayVessel values as needed.
3. Edit `config.php` at the project root with your real `DB_*` constants and `APP_URL`.
4. Create `install/installed.lock` (any content) so the app stops redirecting to the installer.

## Security Implemented

- PDO prepared statements everywhere (no raw string interpolation into SQL)
- `password_hash()` / `password_verify()` (bcrypt, cost 12)
- CSRF tokens on every state-changing form (`includes/security.php`)
- Session hardening: httponly + samesite cookies, periodic ID regeneration
- Brute-force protection: 5 failed attempts → 15 minute lockout (`login_attempts` table)
- Selector/validator "remember me" tokens (never store the raw cookie value)
- Output escaping via `e()` helper (`htmlspecialchars` wrapper)
- Upload validation by real MIME sniffing (`finfo`), not file extension
- `uploads/` and internal folders (`config`, `includes`, `database`, `logs`) blocked from direct web access via `.htaccess`
- Activity logging (`activity_logs`) for auth events and admin actions
- Generic (non-enumerable) responses on forgot-password requests

## Build Status

### ✅ Module 1 — Foundation, Database, Installer, Authentication
- Full folder structure and `.htaccess` hardening
- `.env` support + generated `config.php` + `config/constants.php`
- Complete `database.sql` covering every module in the spec (users, wallets,
  referrals, mining, tasks, ads, spin wheel, check-ins, deposits,
  withdrawals, KYC, notifications, activity logs, site settings)
- 4-step installation wizard (`/install`)
- Registration, login, logout, remember-me, email verification,
  resend-verification, forgot/reset password
- Admin login + minimal admin dashboard shell
- Core wallet ledger primitives (`includes/wallet.php`) used by every future earning module
- Premium fintech design system (`assets/css/theme.css`) with light/dark mode, self-hosted Poppins + Bootstrap Icons, glassmorphism cards, toasts, skeleton loaders

### ✅ Module 2 — Wallet System + Public Landing Page
- Shared authenticated app shell (`includes/partials/app-*.php` +
  `assets/css/app.css`) — collapsible sidebar, topbar with live unread
  notification count and user menu — reused by the dashboard and every
  future user-facing module
- `wallet/index.php` — balance tiles (main/bonus/referral/mining) + recent
  transactions + referral link
- `wallet/history.php` — full ledger with wallet/source/type/date filters
  and pagination
- `user/notifications.php` — real notification feed with mark-all-read
- `user/profile.php` — edit name/phone/avatar, change password
- Full public landing page (`index.php`) — animated hero, features grid,
  how-it-works, live mining plans pulled from the database, referral
  program breakdown (reads live percentages from `site_settings`),
  animated stats counters (real user/payout counts), testimonials, FAQ
  accordion, supported payment methods, newsletter signup and contact
  form (both AJAX, CSRF-protected, backed by `newsletter_subscribers` and
  `contact_messages` tables)
- Seeded starter mining plans (Starter/Bronze/Silver/Gold Miner) so the
  landing page and future Mining module have real data to work with

### 🔜 Next: Module 3 — Mining System
Mining plan purchase flow, active mining dashboard with countdown to next
payout, `cron/mining-payout.php` for automatic daily crediting via
`wallet_credit()`, pause/resume, and mining logs.

### Planned after that
Task center → Watch-to-earn ads → Spin wheel → Daily check-in → Deposits
(PayVessel + manual) → Withdrawals → Admin management modules (users,
deposits, withdrawals, mining, tasks, settings) → Branding asset pack (PNG
exports, social banner, app icon) → Full documentation set (Admin Guide,
Cron Guide, PayVessel Integration Guide, API Docs).
